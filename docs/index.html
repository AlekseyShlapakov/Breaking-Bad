                family in Albuquerque, new Mexico. At the start of the series,

                addiction and lifestyle. After leaving his parents ‘home’, Jesse

                  Henry R. "Hank" Schrader is a high-ranking officer at the Albuquerque office of the Drug 
                  Enforcement Administration (DEA), starting out as a DEA agent alongside his close friend 
                  and partner Steven Gomez, and later being promoted to Assistant Special Agent in Charge 
                  of the DEA (ASAC). Hank is the husband of Marie Schrader and the brother-in-law of Skyler 
                  and Walter White, as well as the uncle of Walter White Jr. and Holly, having a close friendship 
                  with his nephew. As a DEA agent, Hank lead the investigations of the meth cook "Heisenberg".
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hank is faced with numerous threats from the rival drug cartels which take a toll on his mental 
                  health, causing him to develop post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As a hobby, Hank home brews 
                  his own Schraderbräu beer, and also takes up mineral collecting. Despite his brashness, Hank is 
                  highly competent at his job and cares deeply about his family.

                  Skyler "Sky" White (née Lambert) is the wife of Walter White and the sister of Marie Schrader. 
                  She and Walter have a teenage son, Walter White Jr., and an infant daughter, Holly White. She 
                  has had several meager sources of income: writing short stories, selling items on eBay, working 
                  as a bookkeeper, and ultimately helping her husband launder money. Skyler cares for Walter very 
                  much, but their marriage becomes increasingly strained due to his unexplained absences and bizarre 
                  behavior, ultimately leading to their separation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her sister, Marie (Betsy Brandt), is married to a DEA agent, Hank Schrader (Dean Norris). Skyler is 
                  12 years younger than Walt, whom she met when she was a hostess at a diner near Walt's former place 
                  of work, near the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
